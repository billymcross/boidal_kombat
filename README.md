 A music visulizer with boids, made in WebGL.
Music used: "This is Dangerous" by Gvidon, sourced from Pixabay.

-Once you load up the sim, hit any key on your keyboard to initialize it and get the sim running.
-The music player is at the bottom, you might need to scroll just a bit to see it.

Tweakpane parameters:
-the -Dist parameters are all the distances at which the boids will cohere, separate, and align.
-The -Scale parameters multiply each of the cohesion, separation and aligning forces.
-In the Audio tab, all the -Audio parameters adjust how much the music affects each of the forces on the boids.
